work in progress, haven't finished.

Two reasons for building this program
    1. The grocery store I'm working at doesn't have enough scanners for every employee to check where an item belongs.
    2. The item scanner doesn't allow us to locate items by using text.


This project is about building a website that everyone can visit to search for items by name/brand at FreshCo (Whitehorn) from a database on Azure.
The creator or admins are the ones who can add entities to the database.
The event handler will be an Azure function app.
Information such as the brand and name of an item will be retrieved from the Open Food Facts API.
